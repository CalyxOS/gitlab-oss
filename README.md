# GitLab top tiers are free for Open Source Projects

GitLab exists today in large part thanks to the work of a vast community of open source contributors around the world. As a company, we are deeply committed to being a good [steward for the Open Source project](https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship). To give back to this community who gives us so much, we want to enable teams be more efficient, secure, and productive. We believe the best way for them to achieve this is by using as many of the capabilities of GitLab as possible.

As such, we are offering a complimentary license to GitLab Ultimate (self-hosted) or subscription to GitLab Gold (SaaS) to any Open Source project using GitLab.

## Benefits

- Free Ultimate license (self-managed), or alternatively free Gold subscription (hosted at gitlab.com) for Open Source projects.
- Optional paid support at a 95% discount ($4.95/user/month instead of $99/user/month).

## Requirements

To be eligible:
- You need to be a project lead or a core contributor for an active open source project.
- Your project needs to be under an [OSI-accepted open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
- Your project **must not seek to make profit from the resulting project software**.

If you or your company work on commercial projects, please consider our [plans for businesses](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) instead.

If you are not sure whether your project meets these requirements, please send us an email at [opensource@gitlab.com](mailto:opensource@gitlab.com) and we will be happy to help.
