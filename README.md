# GitLab Ultimate or Gold for Open Source Projects

We take our responsibility of open source stewardship very seriously (https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/11/being-a-good-open-source-steward/ and https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/).

GitLab exists today in large part thanks to the work of hundreds of thousands of open source contributors around the world. To give back to this community who gives us so much, we want to help teams be more efficient, secure, and productive. We believe the best way for them to achieve this is by using as many of the capabilities of GitLab as possible.

It has already been the case for years that that any public project on GitLab.com gets all Gold features. We are happy to now offer a complimentary license to GitLab Ultimate (self-hosted) or subscription to GitLab Gold (SaaS) to all open source projects.
