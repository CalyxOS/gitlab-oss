# GitLab Ultimate or Gold for Open Source Projects

We take our responsibility of open source stewardship very seriously
(https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/11/being-a-good-open-source-steward/ and https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/).

GitLab exists today in large part thanks to the work of hundreds of thousands of open source contributors
around the world. To give back to this community who gives us so much, we want to help teams be
more efficient, secure, and productive. We believe the best way for them to achieve this is by
using as many of the capabilities of GitLab as possible.

It has already been the case for years that that any public project on GitLab.com gets all Gold features. We
are happy to now offer a complimentary license to GitLab Ultimate (self-hosted) or subscription to GitLab
Gold (SaaS) to all open source projects.

## Here's how to apply

1.   Edit this file and add an entry to the [Open source projects using GitLab Ultimate or Gold](#open-source-projects-using-gitlab-ultimate-or-gold) 
section at the bottom of this page (all lines required):
